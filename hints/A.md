# A

To read in input, use cin.

For example, read in two integers as:

```cpp
#include "bits/stdc++.h"

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Input is "5 3"
    int a,b;
    // a = 5, b = 3
    cin >> a >> b;
}
```

You will need a read the number of test cases and write a for loop in addition.
