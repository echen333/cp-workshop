# GT Competitive Programming Workshop

Welcome to Competitive Programming at GT's beginner workshop! Our workshop serves as an introduction to competitive programming for students at GT.

Our first workshop is scheduled for two days: **Saturday** (9/21/2024) and **Sunday** (9/22/2024) from **1:30-5:30 PM** in **Klaus (KACB) 1456**. We will cover everything from setting up your environment to basic algorithms, leading you on the path to becoming a seasoned competitive programmer!

This repository serves mainly as an aide for the **asynchronous** section of the beginner workshop. Once everyone has gotten their environment set up and gotten "hello world!" to display on their screen, we will move on to a *code along*, where we share some of the tips and tricks we wish we knew/had when we started solving.

If you haven't already, join our discord [here](https://discord.gg/QYR3XDgda7).

## How does GT Competitive Programming work?

We meet every Thursday at 5 PM in CCB 052, where we will go over problem-solving techniques, algorithms, and various competitive programming topics.

We also have extended practices on Saturday in preparation for competitions like the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest). Learn more the about format of ICPC [here](./appendix/format.md).

Refer to [meta](./appendix/meta.md) for tips on practicing.

If you ever need any assistance throughout, let any of the officers know. We should be walking around during the workshop.

To get started, let's first [setup your environment](./2_setup.md).
