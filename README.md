# gt-competitive-programming-workshop

Welcome to Competitive Programming at GT's beginner workshop! Our workshop serves as an introduction to competitive programming for first and second-year students at GT.

Our workshop is scheduled for three days from Tuesday, 9/5 to Thursday, 9/7, from 5-7PM each day in CCB . We will cover everything from setting up your environment to basic algorithms, leading you on the path to becoming a seasoned competitive programmer!

## What is competitive programming?

Competitive programming is the sport of solving well-defined problems by writing computer programs under specified limits. It involves a combination of problem-solving, coding skills, and the ability to perform under pressure.

Some problems you could encounter are mathematical puzzles, shortest path problems, and optimization problems. Further, from [usaco.guide](https://usaco.guide/general/intro-cp?lang=cpp),

> A programming competition generally lasts for several hours and consists of a set of problems. These problems are not open problems; they have already been solved by the problem writers and testers and are designed to be solved in the short timeframe of a contest. In general, each problem in competitive programming is solved with a two-step process:
> 1. coming up with the algorithm, which involves problem solving skills and intuition
> 2. implementing the algorithm, which requires programming skills to translate the algorithm into working code.
> 
> For each problem, you submit the completed code to a grader, which checks the answers calculated by your program against a set of predetermined test cases. For each problem, you are given a time limit (usually 2 seconds) and a memory limit (usually 256 megabytes) that your program must satisfy.
> 
> For those of you with experience in software development, note that competitive programming is quite different, as the goal is to write programs that compute the correct answer, run quickly, and can be implemented quickly. Note that nowhere was maintainability of code mentioned. You don't need to bother documenting your code because it only needs to be readable to you during the contest. That being said, you probably want to maintain a bare minimum level of readability so you can keep track of what's going on.

## How does GT Competitive Programming work?

We meet every Thursday at 5 PM, where we will go over problem-solving techniques, algorithms, and various competitive programming topics.

We also have extended practices on Saturday in preparation for competitions like the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest). Learn more the about format of ICPC [here](./appendix/format.md).

We believe you get out what you put into the club. Success in competitive programming surprisingly boils down to hard work and determination  much more than optimal learning. See [meta](./appendix/meta.md) for more information.

If you ever need any assistance throughout, let any of the [officers](./appendix/officers.md) know. We should be walking around during the workshop.

To get started, let's first [setup your environment](./1_setup.md).
