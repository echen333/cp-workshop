# gt-competitive-programming-workshop

Welcome to our beginner workshop! Our workshop serves as an introduction to competitive programming for first and second-year students at GT.

Our workshop is scheduled for three days from Tuesday, 9/5 to Thursday, 9/7, and will cover everything from setup to basic algorithms, leading you on the path to becoming a seasoned competitive programmer!

You can find our [discord here](https://discord.gg/QYR3XDgda7).

## What is competitive programming?

Competitive programming is the sport of solving well-defined problems by writing computer programs under specified limits. It involves a combination of algorithmic problem-solving, coding skills, and the ability to perform under pressure. 

Some problems you could encounter are mathematical puzzles, shortest path problems, and optimization problems. You will have to code up your solutions, which are tested against the system's test cases. This checks for if they produce the correct answer under the alotted amount of time.

Some responses you might get after submitting are:

- AC (Accepted): Solution passed all tests and is correct.
- WA (Wrong Answer): Solution produced incorrect output.
- TLE (Time Limit Exceeded): Solution took too long to run.
- MLE (Memory Limit Exceeded): Solution used too much memory.
- RTE (Runtime Error): Solution failed while running (e.g., division by zero).


## How does GT Competitive Programming work?

We meet every Thursday at 5 PM, where we will go over problem-solving techniques, algorithms, and various competitive programming topics.

We also have extended practices on the weekends in preparation for competitions like the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest). Learn more the about format [here](./appendix/format.md).

We believe you get out what you put into the club. Success in competitive programming surprisingly boils down to hard work and determination  much more than optimal learning. See [meta](./meta.md) for more information.

If you ever need any assistance throughout, let any of the [officers](./appendix/officers.md) know. We should be walking around during the workshop.

To get started, let's first [setup your environment](./1_setup.md).
