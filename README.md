# gt-competitive-programming-workshop

Welcome to our beginner workshop! Our workshop serves as an introduction to competitive programming for first and second-year students at GT.

Our workshop is scheduled for three days from Tuesday, 9/5 to Thursday, 9/7, and will cover everything from setup to basic algorithms, leading you on the path to becoming a seasoned competitive programmer!

## What is competitive programming?

Competitive programming is the sport of solving well-defined problems by writing computer programs under specified limits. It involves a combination of algorithmic problem-solving, coding skills, and the ability to perform under pressure. 

Some problems you could encounter are mathematical puzzles, shortest path problems, and optimization problems. You will then have some time (from tens of minutes to hours) to write code up your solutions. These solutions are then tested and ran under hidden test cases, ensuring they produce the correct answer under the alotted amount of time.

## How does GT Competitive Programming work?

We meet every Tuesday at 5 PM, where we will go over problem-solving techniques, algorithms, and various competitive programming topics.

We also have extended practices on the weekends in preparation for competitions like the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest).

We believe you get out what you put into the club. Dedication, hard work, and collaboration are key to success in competitive programming.

If you ever need any assistance throughout, let any of the [officers](./appendix/officers.md) know. We should be walking around during lecture time. Don't be afraid to ask for hints from any of us too!

To get started, let's first [setup your environment](./1_setup.md).
