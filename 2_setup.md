# Setup

*Prev: [What is competitive programming?](./1_what_is_competitive_programming.md)*

At GT Competitive Programming, we **strongly** encourage everyone to use C++. If you know Java or Python, that's great! These languages have similar constructs, and you should be able to pick up C++ quickly.

## Why C++

C++ is commonly used for systems programming due to its speed and efficient coding. Its clear syntax helps in writing complex algorithms concisely, making it popular for competitive programming. It offers:

- Faster execution compared to languages like Python.
- A robust Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures and algorithms.
- Low-level memory access for optimization.

## Can you use Java or Python or {Other Language}?

Yes. It will be easier to pick up competitive programming if you aren't also learning a new language. Competitve programming as a whole can be hard to dive into, and foreign syntax can add to the frustration. However:

- There are lots more resources online that teach/share tricks for competitive programming in C++.
- The C++ standard library covers everything that you need. Python, for example, does not have a sorted set (used in many problems!) in its standard library.
- There are certain (rare) problems that you will not earn points for (even with the correct solution) simply because Python/Java is too slow.
- This beginner workshop will only cover C++ ðŸ¤¡.

## Install C++

### On Macs (both silicon and pre-silicon)

- Check if you have Homebrew installed by opening Terminal and running `brew --version`. If not installed, proceed to the next step.
- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager for macOS, by following the instructions on their website or running the provided installation script in Terminal.
- Open Terminal and run `brew install gcc` to install the GNU Compiler Collection, which includes C++.
- Verify the installation by running `g++ --version` in Terminal. You should see information about the installed version.
  - Modern gcc compiler binaries typically ship with the version number attached to the name (e.g. the binary name will be `g++-14` instead of simply `g++`). You can still map it to `g++` by creating a symlink.
  - Find the path to the compiler binary that Homebrew installed. For example, mine was installed at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/14.1.0_2/bin/g++-14`.
  - Create a symlink in your `/usr/local/bin/` directory (create it if it does not exist) with the command `ln -s <path to your Homebrew g++> /usr/local/bin/g++`. If you already have a symlink in that directory, do `-sf` instead of `-s` to overwrite it. You may need to prefix the command with `sudo` to gain permissions to write to that directory.
- **UPD: You should not need to do the following steps if you compile with g++ from Homebrew, as that should already ship with `bits/stdc++.h`.** To include headers, open `Finder` and navigate to filepath `/usr/local/include/bits/`, creating directories as needed. Create a file in the `bits` folder named `stdc++.h` and paste the file contents from [including_bits.md](./appendix/including_bits.md) into it.
  - Now you should be all set to write `#include "bits/stdc++.h"` in your C++ programs. Think of this as `import` in Java and Python.
  - Note: do not use include with angle brackets for bits, use quotes.
  <!-- - `TODO`: include terminal commands since hard to find in `Finder`. -->

**Note**: Ask any of the officers for help if you need.

### On Windows

- We will install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This is a virtual-machine-like Linux system that runs on Windows that gives you the pros of Linux without the configuration hassle.
  - We will install the Ubuntu distribution of Linux. You can read more about WSL [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
- Open PowerShell and type `wsl --install`.
  - If you see the WSL help text, WSL is already installed on your system. Proceed to the next step.
- The first time you launch a newly installed Linux distribution, a console window will open and you'll be asked to wait for files to de-compress and be stored on your machine. All future launches should take less than a second.
- You can now access WSL by typing `wsl` in PowerShell/CMD.
  - You will know you are in WSL when the last character of the current line is `$`.
  - Logout by pressing Ctrl+D or typing exit and pressing enter.
- In WSL, **proceed to the Linux installation instructions**.

**Note**: Ask any of the officers for help if you need.
**Note**: You can also [install C++ with TDM-GCC/MinGW](./appendix/windows_old_setup.md) (not recommended).

### On Linux

- Open a terminal and run `sudo apt install build-essential`
- Once that finishes, run `g++ --version` in the terminal to verify it installed properly.

**Note**: Ask any of the officers for help if you need.

3. Verify your account through your email.
4. To join the GT Competitive Programming group, click [this link](https://codeforces.com/group/j7YsoIFtw4/contests) or navigate to the group page and request to join as a Participant on the right-side panel.

## IDE

We recommend VS Code for competitive programming. Refer to [our VS Code guide](./appendix/vscode.md) for setup instructions. Everything up to and including the section "Compiling and Executing a C++ Program" is necessary, while the sections after are for quality of life (but encouraged to follow after the workshop).

## Template Code

We provide a starting code template at [template.cpp](./appendix/template.cpp). This template includes essential libraries and fast Input/Ouput (fastIO).

## Run Hello World Locally

1. Create a new cpp file and paste the following code into it.

   ```cpp
   #include <bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
     cout << "Hello World" << '\n';
   }
   ```

2. Compile and run the code according to the instructions in the [VS Code setup guide](./appendix/vscode.md). You should see the output "Hello World" in your terminal.

**Congrats!**. You can write and run C++ on your system! We will move on to the *code along* lecture once everyone has reached this step.

Otherwise, you can move on to [solving your first problem](./3_solve_your_first_problem.md) while you wait.
