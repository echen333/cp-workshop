# Practice

*Prev: [Solve Your First Problem](./3_solve_your_first_problem.md)*

See if you can solve the first five problems: A,B,C,D,E. and report back to here after! Hints are provided in the hints folder! Try to code it all up yourself.

Great job so far! Hopefully by now you are getting the hang of things.

Some tips on things we want you to keep in mind when solving the rest of the problemset.

- Make sure you understand the problem. **Read the problem twice.** Spending five extra minutes reading the problem or going through test cases is much better spent than implementing the problem and figuring out you solved the wrong problem.
- Before you code, really think about how you would implement your algorithm.
- If you've spent more than 15 minutes(?) implementing the problems here or get really icky code, consider if you could solve it an easier way. There should be very few problems that can't be solved in <15? lines.
- Don't be afraid of giving up or asking for help. The problems are meant to be hard.
- Even if give up and read the solution, **still implement it yourself**. Easy problems should take little time to implement, and you can only internalize very hard problems by coding them.
- If you get frustrated, take a break. We love to chat too!

## Debugging Your Submission

"Debugging is hard: you'd much rather have not made the bug in the first place." - [Ben Qi](https://web.archive.org/web/20221101102128/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Qi)

## Time Complexity

You may have noticed us talking about Big O Notation a lot. Big O is a powerful tool to let you estimate if your solution will run in time before you code it! We will dive more into this in the [next section](./5_introduction_to_time_complexity.md).
