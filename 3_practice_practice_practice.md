See if you can solve the first five problems: A,B,C,D,E. and report back to here after!

Great job! Hopefully by now you are getting the hang of things.

In all the previous questions, our programs run very quickly. But to determine how fast our more complex programs need to run, we will need [time complexity](./4_introduction_to_time_complexity.md).

also will prob really need an introduction to C++ like primitives and arrays and loops. prob include in appendix.

Some tips:

- If you get stuck, read the hints.
- Make sure you understand the problem. Read the problem twice. Spending five extra minutes reading the problem or going through test cases is much better spent than implementing the problem and figuring out you solved the wrong problem.
- Before you code, I would recommend you to really think about how you would implement it.
- If you've spent more than 15 minutes(?) implementing the problems here or get really icky code, consider if you could solve it an easier way. There should be very few problems that can't be solved in <15? lines.
- Even if the problem is way too easy or way too hard, still take the time to implement it. Easy problems should take little time to implement, and you can only internalize very hard problems by coding them.
- If you get frustrated, take a break. We love to chat too!
