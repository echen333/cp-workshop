See if you can solve the first five problems: A,B,C,D,E. and report back to here after!

Great job! Hopefully by now you are getting the hang of things.

In all the previous questions, our programs run very quickly. But to determine how fast our more complex programs need to run, we will need [time complexity](./4_introduction_to_time_complexity.md).

also will prob really need an introduction to C++ like primitives and arrays and loops. prob include in appendix.
