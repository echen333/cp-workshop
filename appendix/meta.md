# How to Practice

*How to practice and when to read editorials (analyses) according to various USACO competitors.*

## Max Zhang

I think a lot of times we obsess over the right way to get into something or the perfectly efficient path to success, so much that it paralyzes us and we never actually start. Just start doing problems. Do contests. See what works for you and what doesn't. Reflect and adjust accordingly. What works for someone else may not work for you, and being successful is just finding the right method of improvement for you.

> Reaching a high level in competitive programming requires dedication and motivation. For many people, their practice is inefficient because they do problems that are too easy, too hard, or simply of the wrong type.
>
>In the lower divisions, most problems use relatively elementary algorithms; the main challenge is deciding which algorithm to use, and implementing it correctly. In a contest, you should spend the bulk of your time thinking about the problem and coming up with the algorithm, rather than typing code. Thus, you should practice your implementation skills, so that during the contest, you can implement the algorithm quickly and correctly, without resorting to debugging.
>
>Problems that you practice with should be of the appropriate difficulty. You don't necessarily need to complete all the exercises at the end of each module, just do what you think is right for you. A problem at the right level of difficulty should be one of two types: either you struggle with the problem for a while before coming up with a working solution, or you miss it slightly and need to consult the solution for some small part. If you instantly come up with the solution, a problem is likely too easy, and if you're missing multiple steps, it might be too hard.

They discuss such things as time management, the problem-solving process, and other tips that you may find useful. See my FAQ for more information.

> If you're still coming up with new ideas, keep thinking. Otherwise, you have several options to get unstuck on your own:
> 
> - Look at the tags (if available).
> - Read (part of) the official solution.
> - Read someone else's solution code (if publicly available).
>   - This can often be helpful even if you've already solved the problem yourself, as top competitors sometimes come up with cleaner approaches than the official one.
> - Leave it for a while and do something else for a few hours or days (if you want to solve it wholly on your own). Often you'll come up with new ideas in the meantime.
> 
> In any case, if you thought about a problem a lot during a contest but didn't end up solving it, then I don't see any reason not to read the editorial when it comes out (vs. continuing to think about it on your own). Also, unless you understand the solution perfectly, you should always implement the solution afterward.
