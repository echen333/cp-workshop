# How to Practice

*How to practice and when to read editorials (analyses) according to various Competitive Programmers.*

## Max Zhang

I think a lot of times we obsess over the right way to get into something or the optimal path to success, so much that it paralyzes us and we never actually start. Just start doing problems. Do contests. See what works for you and what doesn't. Reflect and adjust accordingly. What works for someone else may not work for you, and being successful is just finding the right method of improvement for you.

## Jeffrey Chang

My recommendations for improvement are generic, but in this case, the generic advice is good advice.

First, attempt to do problems just outside your skill level. They shouldn't be too hard or too easy (although easy problems may be more fun). Your goal should be to learn how to solve problems. I like using question difficulty ratings on codeforces and kenkoooo.com for atcoder. The main way to improve is always to just do more problems, so the more time you spend, the better you'll get.

Second, don't spend too long on a question, especially when you start. If it takes you more than 20 minutes to formulate a solution, read their solution and move on. You'll want to see a lot of different problems to learn.

Third, make sure you understand their solution. This means figuring out why the solution works and why you want to use whatever algorithm or data structure. This is far more important than solving an individual question, because you learn how to think.

Fourth, plan out your code on paper. Paper is a good habit because you can often find logic errors on paper. Additionally, don't spend too long coding a problem (<30 min).

Fifth, this might be controversial but learning debugging is kinda a waste of time. If your code doesn't work but you can't figure out why, just read their solution and understand how they coded it. Imo, you just learn debugging and better coding habits over time regardless and the main focus for improving should be the concepts.

Sixth, ask people for help. The discord is a great place to get help and other people are great resources ðŸ™‚

Last, but most definitely not least (actually the most important thing). Competitive programming should be a lot of fun and not a homework. It's a lot easier to spend another 5 hours on an ICPC set on my weekend because I find it fun to solve problems and program solutions. Make friends or recruit your friends to join you, so you have a good time doing competitive programming!

## Edward Chen

Practice on Codeforces problems a little above your rating. Judge your progress by how many difficult problems you've completed. Don't worry too much about your rating, it lags behind your skill.

> Reaching a high level in competitive programming requires dedication and motivation. For many people, their practice is inefficient because they do problems that are too easy, too hard, or simply of the wrong type.
>
>In the lower divisions, most problems use relatively elementary algorithms; the main challenge is deciding which algorithm to use, and implementing it correctly. In a contest, you should spend the bulk of your time thinking about the problem and coming up with the algorithm, rather than typing code. Thus, you should practice your implementation skills, so that during the contest, you can implement the algorithm quickly and correctly, without resorting to debugging.
>
>Problems that you practice with should be of the appropriate difficulty. You don't necessarily need to complete all the exercises at the end of each module, just do what you think is right for you. A problem at the right level of difficulty should be one of two types: either you struggle with the problem for a while before coming up with a working solution, or you miss it slightly and need to consult the solution for some small part. If you instantly come up with the solution, a problem is likely too easy, and if you're missing multiple steps, it might be too hard.

> If you're still coming up with new ideas, keep thinking. Otherwise, you have several options to get unstuck on your own:
> 
> - Look at the tags (if available).
> - Read (part of) the official solution.
> - Read someone else's solution code (if publicly available).
>   - This can often be helpful even if you've already solved the problem yourself, as top competitors sometimes come up with cleaner approaches than the official one.
> - Leave it for a while and do something else for a few hours or days (if you want to solve it wholly on your own). Often you'll come up with new ideas in the meantime.
> 
> In any case, if you thought about a problem a lot during a contest but didn't end up solving it, then I don't see any reason not to read the editorial when it comes out (vs. continuing to think about it on your own). Also, unless you understand the solution perfectly, you should always implement the solution afterward.
