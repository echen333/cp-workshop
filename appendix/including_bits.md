# Extra: Fast Compile bits/stdc++.h

For faster compilation, precompiling the `bits/stdc++.h` header can be beneficial. The steps for this might vary between systems, so consult online resources specific to your setup or reach out to a club member familiar with your OS.

If you have installed g++ as described before, you can use #include <bits/stdc++.h> in place of separately including libraries.
