# Format of ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)

Regional Contests

- Eligibility: Open to university students.
- Team Formation: Teams consist of three students from the same university.
- Problem Set: Typically 8-12 algorithmic problems.
- Time Limit: Generally 5 hours.
- Scoring: Teams are ranked by the number of problems solved. Ties are broken by the total time taken to solve them.

Getting to WF requires a LOT of preparation.
